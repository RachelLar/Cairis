      CAIRIS supports the association of assets, inconsistency checking between associated assets, and visualisation of asset models.
      					<p>The CAIRIS asset model is based on UML class models. Asset models can be viewed for each defined environment. As well as explicitly defined asset associations, 
      					asset models will also contain associations implicitly defined. For example, if a task has been defined, and this task concerns within an environment contain one or 
      					more assets, then the participating persona will be displayed as an actor, and an association between this actor and the asset will be displayed. Additionally, 
      					if concern associations have been defined between goals and assets and/or associations then zooming into the model will display these concerns; the concerns are 
      					displayed as blue comment elements.</p>

      <div class="panel-body">In CAIRIS, a requirements specification is analogous to a safety case. In a safety case, a system is only considered safe if its safety goals have been satisfied
      . 
      <p> In a similar manner, requirements are leaf nodes in a goal tree and satisfying stakeholder needs is only possible if the high-level goals – stipulated by stakeholders – 
      can be satisfied.</p>
      
      <p>We define goals as prescriptive statements of system intent that are achievable by one or more agents. Goals can be refined to requirements, which are achievable by only agent. Goals and requirements may also be operationalised 
      as tasks. Alternatively, we may decide to specify tasks and ask what goals or requirements need to hold in order that a given task can be completed successfully.</p>
		<p>To satisfy a goal, one or more sub-goals may need to be satisfied; satisfaction may require satisfying a conjunction of sub-goals, i.e. several AND goals, or a disjunction of sub-goals, i.e. several OR goals.</p>      					
      <p>Goals or requirements may be obstructed by obstacles, which are conditions representing undesired behaviour; these prevent an associated goal from being achieved. By progressively refining obstacles, we can obtain the origin of some undesired behaviour; this may be reflected as a vulnerability or 
      a threat, and contribute to risk analysis.</p>

						<div id="collapse16" class="panel-collapse collapse">
							      <div class="panel-body">Security Patterns are solution structures, which prescribe a solution to a security problem arising in a context. Many components and c
							      onnectors in secure system architectures are instances of security patterns but, in many cases, the reasoning for a given pattern’s inclusion is not always clear. 
							      The requirements needed to realise these patterns are also often omitted, making the job of reasoning about the consequences of situating the pattern difficult. 
							      Moreover, security patterns may be described in a context, but not all collaborating assets in a security pattern may be evident in all possible contexts of a 
							      system’s use. The following sections describe how CAIRIS treats security patterns and deals with these weaknesses.
							     <br>
							     <br>
							     <strong>Security Patterns in CAIRIS consist of the following elements:</strong>
							     	<ol>
							     		<li>A description of the context a pattern is relevant for.</li>
							     		<br>
							     		<li>A problem statement motivating the need for the pattern.</li>
							     		<br>
							     		<li>A solution statement describing the intrinsics of the pattern.</li>
							     		<br>
							     		<li>The pattern structure, modelled as associations between collaborating asset classes.</li>
							     		<br>
							     		<li>A set of requirements, which need to be fulfilled in order to realise the pattern.</li>
							     		
							     	</ol>
							     
							     		
							     		<p>Before a security pattern can be defined in CAIRIS, template assets – which represent the collaborating asset classes – need to be first defined.</p>
							     		
							     		<p>Before a security pattern can be situated in CAIRIS environments, the environments themselves need to be first created.</p>

															<li>Template assets can be best described as context-free assets. When they are created, template assets do not form part of analysis unless they are implicitly introduced. This ‘implicit introduction’ occurs when a security 
															pattern is situated.</li>
															                      
								                     <br>
															<li>The Template Patterns dialog can be opened by selecting the Options/Template Assets menu option.</li>
															<br>
															<li>The process for creating, updating, and deleting a template asset is almost identical to the processes uses for normal assets. The only difference is the lack of environment-specific properties. 
															Security properties are only defined once for the asset.</li>
															<br>      
															<li>To situate an asset in an environment, right click on the template asset name in the Template Assets dialog box, select the Situate option, and specify the environments to situate the template asset in. After a template asset is situated within an environment, these properties should be revised in the assets generated on the basis of these. 
															This is because the values associated with the template asset properties may not be inline with assumptions held about Low, Medium, and High assets
															 in the specification being developed.</li>
